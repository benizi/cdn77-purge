# NOT WORKING

This is not working currently, since CDN77 prefetch-api cannot handle a url like /about-us/ as a page. It assumes it is a directory. I am waiting for a fix.

There are other issues I hope CDN77 will fix
 * forward the etag
 * forward the last-modified
so I do not have to compare page by contents, and just can do all this by using HEAD instead of GET.

# cdn77purge

Make sure CDN77 has the lastest files.

This program should be run after an update of my web site content in Wordpress at my origin.

I have a slightly different setup than most, since my complete site is hosted on the CDN.

Advantage, you get a lot of speed.

Disadvantage, more work, for example the site map generated by my origin (wordpress) points to the origin, and not to the CDN. Also, all pages generated by WP needs to be static, which is not a problem for me, since I have not basket, and rely on Google analytics.

## Installation

Clone, compile using "lein compile" and "lein repl" and run (force-refresh).

You will need to create a cdn77.config files that looks like this and edit the path to it.

```
{:login "email"
 :passwd "cdn77key"
 :cdn_id "6534784"
 :origin "http://www2.spreadsheetconverter.com"
 :cdn "http://www.spreadsheetconverter.com"
 }	
```
